<p>Form fields are used to gather information from a site visitor. Form fields should be easily accessible to both desktop and mobile users, and as such they should be sized in a way that allows for access using either a mouse or a touch screen. Use form fields sparingly to avoid user fatigue, and make your form labels as clear and concise as possible.</p>
